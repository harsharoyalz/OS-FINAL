about round robin Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way. 
It is simple, easy to implement, and starvation-free as all processes get fair share of CPU. 
It is pre-emptive as processes are assigned CPU only for a fixed slice of time at most. 
The disadvantage of it is more overhead of context switching. 
completion Time: Time at which process completes its execution. 
Turn Around Time: Time Difference between completion time and arrival time. Turn Around Time = Completion Time â€ “Arrival Time Waiting Time (W.T): Time Difference between turnaround time and burst time. Waiting Time = Turn Around Time â€ “Burst Time. 
example: using round-robin algorithm having same arrival time with time quantum 1 unit and to find average waiting and turnaround time.

Algorithm for round- robin scheduling with zero as arrival time for all processes as follows:
Create an array rem_bt[] to keep track of remaining burst time of processes. This array is initially a copy of bt[] (burst times array)
Create another array wt[] to store waiting times of processes. Initialize this array as 0.
Initialize time : t = 0
Keep traversing the all processes while all processes are not done. Do following for i'th process if it is not done yet.
    If rem_bt[i] > quantum
       (i)  t = t + quantum
       (ii) bt_rem[i] -= quantum;
    Else // Last cycle for this process
       (i)  t = t + bt_rem[i];
       (ii) wt[i] = t - bt[i]
       (ii) bt_rem[i] = 0; // This process is over
       
  Once we have waiting times, we can compute turn around time_tat[I] of a process as sum of waiting and burst times, i.e., wt[i] + bt[i].

round-robin scheduling algorithm with differnt arrival time  to find the avergae waiting and turn around time
Quantum time is 3 this means each process is only executing for 3 units of time at a time.
PROCESS	ARRIVALTIME	BURST TIME
P1	      0	            10
P2	      1	            4
P3	      2           	5
P4	      3           	3
Completion Time: the time taken for a process to complete.
Turn Around Time: total time the process exists in system.(completion time – arrival time).
Waiting Time: total time the waiting for there complete execution.(turn around time – burst time ).
Algorithm for round-robin scheduling algorithm with differnt arrival time is as follows :
    Create two arrays of burst time res_b[] and of arrival time res_a[] and copy the value of the b[] and a[] array for calculate the remaining time.(b[] is burst time, a[] arrival time).
Create an another array for wt[] to store waiting time.
Initialize Time : t=0;
Keep traversing the all process while all 
   process are not done.
   Do following for i'th process if it is not done yet.
   a- if res_a[i]<= q   (quantum time :- q)
        1. if res_b[i]>q 
             a. t=t+q
             b. res_b[i]-=q;
             c. a[i]+=q;
        2. else res_b[i]<=q(for last to execute)
              a. t=t+b[i];
              b. wt[i]=t-b[i]-a[i];
              c.res_b[i]=0;
    b- else res_a[i]<q
          1. Initialize j=0 to number of process
             if a[j]<a[i] (compare is there any 
             other process come before these process)
                    1. if res_b[j]>q 
                            a. t=t+q
                            b. res_b[j]-=q;
                            c. a[j]+=q;
                    2. else res_b[j]<=q
                           a. t=t+b[j];
                           b. wt[j]=t-b[j]-a[j];
                           c.res_b[j]=0; 
          2. now we executing the i'th process 
                      1. if res_b[i]>q 
                            a. t=t+q
                            b. res_b[i]-=q;
                            c. a[i]+=q;
                      2. else res_b[i]<=q
                            a. t=t+b[i];
                            b. wt[i]=t-b[i]-a[i];
                            c.res_b[i]=0;
